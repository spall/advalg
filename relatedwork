Work on the Shortest common superstring problem has been around since 1977. In 1980 Gallant et al. in \textit{On Finding Minimal length superstrings}\cite{gallant1980finding} set the basis for work on the shortest common superstring problem. 

In Gallant, the researchers prove that given a set of strings $S$ and a positive length $K$ as well as an unbounded alphabet $\sum$ over those strings, that determining if $S$ has a superstring of length $K$ is NP-Complete. The authors do this by reducing to the \textit{Hamiltonian  path problem}. The Hamiltonian path problem is the problem where one determines in a directed or undirected graph whether there exists a path that visits each vertex only once. The Hamiltonian path problem was known to be NP-Complete so a reduction ultimately proves the completeness of the other problem \cite{michael1979computers}. Throughout all newer papers on the SCS problem each paper reduces the problem to the Hamiltonian path problem while using different tricks to reduce the SCS. 


In 1988 Jorma Tarhio and Esko Ukkonen, authored \textit{A Greedy Approximation Algorithm for Constructing Common Superstrings} \cite{tarhio1988greedy}. Their paper developed a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that would construct a superstring within some \epsilon of the optimal solution. Their approxmiation algorithm is based off a greedy heuristic. At a high level their algorithm is given a set $S$ of strings over the alphabet $\sum$ select two strings which have the greatest mutual overlap. From there the algorithm merges the two strings and replaces the single combined string in $S$. An example would be the set $S = {aabb, bbbaaa, aaaa}$ The algorithm would select $bbbaaa$ and $aaaa$, merging and replacing so the set looks like $S = { aabb, bbbaaaa }$. The algorithm at finer detail is implemented using, once again, Hamiltonian Cycles.
