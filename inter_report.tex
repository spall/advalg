\maketitle

problem being solved:

previously defined shortest super strings problem
the problem is known to be NP-hard, but there is a 
greedy solution that at the time of the paper was used
in DNA sequencing and data compression.  

work done in this paper:
show ``greedy algo'' has upper bound of 4n, when only
previous nontrivial algo is O(nlogn)???



main result:

present new simplified greedy algo that produces
a superstring of length at most 3n.  

so they improve on previous work, by setting new upper bound
and new greedy algo (upper bound of the length)

also show problem to be MAX SNP-hard, which implies 
ptas is unlikely? what is ptas
